#like an "aha" moment when my code made a bar chart using a csv file
#like now i get it. python is to powerbi data and csv files what being able to write vba was for excel
#or what SQL was for Access back in the day
#lighting up about why it makes so much sense to be able to be efficient and advanced in data work to write python for data visualizations and reporting in powerbi
#thankful that I finally made the connection why python is useful and how to APPLY code to action

#here's another snippet of code. nothing spectacular. 
#I read a csv file and used the pandas to make a bar chart leveraging capability from matplotlib and seaborn. 



import codecademylib3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

# Create a bar chart for movie genre 
sns.countplot(x='genre', data=movies)
plt.show()
plt.close()
