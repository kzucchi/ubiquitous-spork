#I spent 5 years kinda fumbling with Python then a few weeks ago saw how valuable it is for automating things in PowerBI. 
#Now I'm working from a place of passion instead of "value" and everything is "clicking". 
#Putting a lot of code into my Jupyter notebook, but leaving a couple samples here.

#example how to use pandas to count the number of records by column in a database
#database is called movies in a csv file
#columns refer to genres as the column attribute


import pandas as pd

movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

# Save the counts to genre_counts
genre_counts = movies.genre.value_counts()
print(genre_counts)
